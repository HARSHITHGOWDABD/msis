# COMMANDS IN LINUX TO EXEGUTE THE CODE 

- pwd ----> refers to print the working directory 
- mkdir ---> To create the new directory (make directory )
- cd -------> chanage directory or to get into the file
- gedit -----> to open the greaphical test editor 
- gcc -------> after writing  the code to compile we can use this grahicial compiler 
- ./a.out ---> it will runs the exegutable file .

# EXAMPLE 
 - mkdir 251100630027_harshith  // creates the new directory with the file name  251100630027_harshith
 - cd 251100630027_harshith     // now we will get into this currecnt directory
 - pwd                         // now we are in the currecnt working directory that we created
 - gedit program1.c           // it will open the editor file with the file name as program1.c
 - gcc program1.c            // graphical compiler will just compile the file and shows if their is any error in it
 - ./a.out                  // will runs the exegutable file
